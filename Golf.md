# Tiger Woods how I Play Golf

"Other golfers may outplay me from time to time, but they'll never outwork me"

"I focus only on what I can control"

"..you get out of it what you put in."

"Great players never appear overwhelmed by any situation"

- hands the same distance from body no matter the shot
- Ball position: driver = left heel. PW = center
- Chin-up
- Start slow then power up. Gather speed slowely
- Driver. chase the ball with your hands
- wide stance
- shake hands with the target
